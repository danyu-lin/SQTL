# **SQTL :: Semiparametric QTL Mapping in General Pedigrees**

We implement an efficient and reliable algorithm for the semiparametric QTL mapping method in general pedigrees in the computer program [SQTL](http://dlin.web.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/1568/2013/02/SQTL.zip) for the Linux platform. A brief [documentation](http://dlin.web.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/1568/2013/02/SQTL.zip) is also available. We are currently developing a user-friendly software interface for various platforms. If you would like to be notified upon its initial release, please send an email to \<gdiao\@gmu.edu\> including your name, email address, and institution.
